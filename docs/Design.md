# Developing process

This document is a brief compilation of the thought process and some references used to build this page.

## Which font and palette and why

So for start we are building a website that needs to be very professional, so starting with the font i select [Merriweather Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather+Sans?query=Sorkin+Type&categoryFilters=Feeling:%2FExpressive%2FBusiness) this font look professional but also clear and have 4 tags that make it perfect for this:
- Feeling Competent
- Feeling Sincere
- Feeling Calm
- Feeling Business

Next is the palette. Usually this part requires a defined identity of the web page but, we have enough information in the document to select a propery palette.This is the selected one: 
(Color Pallete)[https://colorswall.com/palette/generate/2c5282-2d3748-f89323-f7fafc-1a202c]

- **Primary**: #2c5282
- **Secondary**: #2d3748
- **Accents**: #f89323
- **Background**: #f7fafc
- **text**: #1a202c

> In the code, we use this as a base, but the color can be quite different.

### Reason
- The blue color helps transmit trust, and its tonality looks very professional, making it suitable for the main elements of the interface.
- The secondary color provides visual stability and helps maintain consistency across different sections of the page.
- The accent color is used to attract the user’s attention and highlight important actions or key information.
